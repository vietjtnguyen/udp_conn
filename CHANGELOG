0.1.1
-----

- No API changes.
- Experienced some unreliability in using the same socket for both sending and
  receiving. There are now two sockets: a receive and a send socket.
- Using connect() and send() to send messages was unreliable in a multi-machine
  test. The connect() call has been dropped and send() has been modified to
  sendto().
